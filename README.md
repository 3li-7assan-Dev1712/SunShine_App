<h1>Welcome you in Sunshine!</h1>
<h2>Quick Overview</h2>
Hi there, welcome in the world of sunshine!, this app is a forecast weather android application
that help users to know the 'today' and the 'forecast' weather for particular days and locations. The
user can choose the location that they want to know its weather through the SettingsActivity of the app, then the
app will bring real a data from the open weather API.
The app automatically sync the data every there hours and sends a notification of the hot potato data from the API,
in addition to that the user can set a widget in the home screen to know the weather of the current day. </br>

<h2>Sunshine in more detail</h2>
Ok, let's have a deeper vision of the sunshine app features. in the very beginning the user will see the MainActivity
where the forecast weather in. When the user clicks on one of those days they will be navigated to the DetailActivity
to see more details about the weather like the humidity and wind speed...
From the MainActivity the user can open the location -that they selected from the SettingsActivity- in the Google map.
Using the SettingsActivity the user can change this location, change the temperature unit and disable or enable the notifications,
and finally anytime the user changes the location the app will automatically sync the database and sends a notification for the
user, but only if the notifications are enabled:) .
